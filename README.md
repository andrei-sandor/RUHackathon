## Inspiration

Our inspiration is the high number of inadequate and incorrect medical treatments in out health care system.
## What it does

This is a software where patients and doctors can login. The patient will answer some medical questions to detect if he has a disease. From there, he will receive an adequate treatment. The doctor can see the data available for his patient. The login page is very complex
## How we built it

We build it with Python. We used extensively sqlite and machine learning
## Challenges we ran into

We add some problems to connect the login page with the treatments algorithms.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We managed in a short amount of time to produce something that has potential.
## What we learned

We learned how to apply in a short amount of time a machine learning algorithm with a lot of difficult features.
## What's next for CureSoft

Improve the patient and doctor experience. Add more diagnoses for other treatments. Connect the database with the treatment algorithms.
